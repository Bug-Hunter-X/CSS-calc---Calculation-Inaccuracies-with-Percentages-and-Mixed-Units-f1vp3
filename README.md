This repository demonstrates a common but subtle issue with the CSS `calc()` function.  The problem arises when using percentages alongside other units (like pixels or ems). The order of operations and unit consistency can significantly impact the results, leading to unexpected layout behavior. The `bug.css` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.css` provides a solution using explicit width definitions and consistent units.
